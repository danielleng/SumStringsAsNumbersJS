# Sum Strings As Numbers
A Javascript function to sum two strings together as numbers. This is inspired from a 4th-kyu Codewars kata.

## Installation
You can just use the code straightaway without any installation. Running `npm install` just installs Facebook's Jest testing suite to run the tests. 
```
npm install
```
`sumstringsasnumbers.js` exports a single function, `sumStringsAsNumbers(a, b)`, that you can import and use. 

## Testing
```
npm test
```
